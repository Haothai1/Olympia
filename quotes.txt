Exercise is labor without weariness
push through the pain
never give up
the pain you feel today is the strength you feel tomorrow
what seems impossible today will one day become your warm-up
if it doesn't challenge you, it doesn't change you
you may not be there yet, but you are closer than you were yesterday
do something today that your future self will thank you for
nothing will work unless you do
will power is like a muscle; the more you train it, the stronger it gets
tought times don't last; tough people do
a little progress each day adds up to big results
your body can do it; it's time to convince your mind
motivation is what gets you started. habit is what keeps you going
winners never quit, and quitters never win
make muscles, not excuses
every day is another chance to be a better version of you
success doesn't start in the gym; it starts in your mind
results happen over time, not overnight
push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you
when you feel like quitting, think about why you started
progress is not perfection
stop saying "i wish", and start saying "i will"
you've got what it takes
if you're tired of starting over, stop giving up
the body achieves what the mind believes
Not finishing is better than never starting
The real workout starts when you want to stop
You miss one hundred percent of the shots you don’t take
Continuous improvement is better than delayed perfection
Success is usually the culmination of controlling failure
It’s hard to beat a person who never gives up
Confidence comes from discipline and training
if you fail to prepare, you’re prepared to fail
a champion is someone who gets up when they can’t
The only bad workout is the one that didn’t happen
You did not wake up today to be mediocre
Action is the foundational key to all success
Don’t dream of winning; Train for it
Exercise should be regarded as a tribute to the heart
